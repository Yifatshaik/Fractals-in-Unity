# Fractals in Unity 3D'
Unity project based on fractals tutorials form https://catlikecoding.com/ and an holographic unity shader tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlYGmVC_Qzg

This project was used to make the following procdural gifs in Unity:

The fractals are procedurally generated, but aside from the colors (which will have to be change in the code) everything else can be changed using the inspector

clicking on the **fractal object** in the hierarchy lets you change the size of the mesh arrays and the mesh, as well as the randomality (of scale, object etc.) and the speed of the object. Selecting the **Fractal Mat** allows you to change the properties of the shader (adding more lines, the speed of the lines etc.)

Background color is changed on the **camera** object
